# 📄 Business-As-Usual (BAU) Documentation for Cloud Migration

## 📌 Purpose
The purpose of this **BAU (Business-As-Usual) Documentation** is to provide a structured and well-documented **operational framework** for managing and maintaining workloads **post-cloud migration**. It ensures smooth IT operations, security compliance, monitoring, and incident management.

---

## 📖 How to Create BAU Documentation

### 🔹 Step 1: Define the Scope
- Identify migrated workloads (**applications, databases, networking components, security policies**).
- Establish operational requirements (**performance, uptime SLAs, backup policies**).
- Define roles & responsibilities (**Cloud Engineers, DevOps, Security, Operations Team**).

### 🔹 Step 2: Infrastructure & Network Architecture
- **Cloud Service Overview**: AWS, Azure, GCP, or Hybrid environment.
- **VPC, Subnet, and Security Groups**: Detailed network segmentation.
- **Load Balancer & DNS Configurations**: Routing & domain management.

### 🔹 Step 3: IAM & Security Management
- **IAM Roles & Policies** 🛡️: Least privilege access controls.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** 🔐: Enforce secure access.
- **Key Management (KMS) & Secrets Manager**: Encrypt sensitive data.
- **Compliance & Audit Logs (CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub)**.

### 🔹 Step 4: Monitoring & Alerting Setup
- **CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus** 📊: Dashboard & alert configurations.
- **Log Aggregation (ELK Stack, CloudTrail, FluentD)**.
- **ITSM Integration (ServiceNow, Jira, PagerDuty)** 🚨: Auto-ticketing for critical issues.

### 🔹 Step 5: Backup & Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective) / RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** definition.
- **Automated Backups & Replication (AWS Backup, Snapshots, DR strategies)**.
- **Disaster Recovery Playbook**: Step-by-step restoration guide.

### 🔹 Step 6: Operational Runbooks & Troubleshooting Guides
- **Common Issues & Resolution Steps** 🔧.
- **Restart Procedures for Cloud Services**.
- **Maintenance Schedules (Patching, Updates, Scaling Events)**.

### 🔹 Step 7: Cost Optimization & Budgeting
- **AWS Cost Explorer / Azure Cost Management** 📉.
- **Rightsizing Recommendations (Auto Scaling, Reserved Instances, Spot Pricing)**.
- **Chargeback & Showback Models**.

## 🏗️ How to Operate BAU in Cloud Migration

### ✅ **Daily Operations**
- Monitor **dashboards & alerts** for performance issues.
- Ensure **scheduled backups** are running as expected.
- Respond to **incidents & security vulnerabilities** promptly.
- Maintain **user access controls & IAM role updates**.

### ✅ **Weekly Operations**
- Review **cost utilization & optimization reports**.
- Perform **infrastructure health checks**.
- Validate **patching & updates for security compliance**.
- Test **disaster recovery plans in a controlled environment**.

### ✅ **Monthly Operations**
- Conduct **capacity planning & forecasting**.
- Generate **ITSM compliance reports (ServiceNow, Jira)**.
- Optimize **performance & scale services accordingly**.

## 🛠️ Key Definitions
- **BAU (Business-As-Usual)**: A structured operational framework to ensure workloads are running efficiently post-migration.
- **ITSM (IT Service Management)**: Integration with tools like **ServiceNow, Jira** for incident response.
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: Defined uptime, RTO, and RPO for cloud applications.
- **CloudWatch / Prometheus / Datadog**: Monitoring & alerting tools for performance tracking.
- **CloudTrail / Security Hub / GuardDuty**: Security logging & compliance management.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
A well-defined **BAU process ensures business continuity, security compliance, and operational efficiency** after cloud migration. By following the structured approach outlined in this document, IT teams can **effectively manage cloud workloads** while optimizing cost, performance, and security. 🚀
